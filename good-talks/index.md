Not mine! Obviously.

Now if you go grab yourself a slow drink or snack, take a breath and relax and try watching some of the videos listed on the page.
I promise you will at least feel inspired, if not feeling smarter.

Some of the listed stuff might feel controversial, and if it sparks a discussion with a colleague - even better. Nothing like a good opinion polarizer to get the brain juices flowing and scopes of worked defined.

Let's go.

## ON SPEAKING

This is a golden talk on how to talk like a professional. It's an old dude I never met who claims to be an MIT professor (he probably is) but dang the talk really is useful and fun to study. Grab a notebook and a pen and take notes, you will not regret it.

### [It's called simply 'How To Speak'. Good to revisit it from time to time.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY)


I wish I have had this lecture while I was at uni, it would have save me lot of life.

## ON LEADERSHIP & GOVERNANCE

The job description for a team lead in one of my previous employers at one time said that it was a requirement to be good at motivating your colleagues.
And it had explicit clause: the motivation is supposed to be done `in non-monetary` ways.

Here we go then, this is a talk that reveals three distinct avenues to unlocking the highly intelligent professional to become your allied partner in crime.

### [RSA ANIMATE: Drive: The surprising truth about what motivates us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc)

Following up on the talk's topic, I also highly recommend reading about some of the key findings done by Google with their fundamental HR studies project called [**re:work**](https://rework.withgoogle.com/en/)

It might be that one thing you are missing to make your organization work like you dreamed it would.

It totally worked at one of my previous employers for me and my team at one time, and I wish you all to experience it.

## TALKING ABOUT WORK


### [User Stories: What they are, how to write them, and why they work.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q5-cVeNjCE)

The gist of what you are supposed to do with a ticket. It echoes back to human-first approaches in general.

It also talks about finding the balance between short-term and long-term survival and/or competitiveness of your business.
