I know you won't take time to read stuff. I won't either. So here are some videos you could at least listen to while you commute to git gut.

Not mine! Well-trusted pros came up with these, obviously.

Now grab yourself a slow drink or a snack, take a breath, and try watching some of the videos listed on this page.  
I promise you’ll at least feel inspired—if not outright smarter.

Some of this might feel controversial. If it sparks a discussion with a colleague—even better. Nothing like a good opinion polarizer to get the brain juices flowing and scopes of work in flight defined.

Also, if you're ever stuck in a slow patch at the office or between meetings—why not throw one of these on a screen and watch it together? It's better than awkward silence and might actually lead somewhere useful.

Let’s go.

## ON SPEAKING

This is a gold-standard talk on how to communicate like a pro. The speaker? A sharp MIT professor with decades of teaching under his belt. Don’t let the age or style fool you—it’s a masterclass in clarity and delivery.

### [“How To Speak”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY) (1h)

Wish I’d had this lecture back in uni—it would’ve saved me a lot of life (and probably a few presentations too).

## ON LEADERSHIP & GOVERNANCE

At one of my previous jobs, the team lead role had this curious clause in the description: you had to be able to *motivate your colleagues*—but **in non-monetary ways**.

So here’s a classic that lays out *three core levers* to unlock collaboration with highly intelligent people—and build trust that lasts.

### [RSA ANIMATE: Drive – The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc) (10 min)

And if you’re hungry for more, read about [**Google's re:Work**](https://rework.withgoogle.com/en/).  
Their HR research hit hard in a good way. One of my previous teams ran on its principles—it made all the difference. And I wish everyone got to experience it.

## TALKING ABOUT WORK

### [User Stories: What They Are, How to Write Them, and Why They Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q5-cVeNjCE) (50 min)

The gist of what you’re actually supposed to do with a ticket.  
This one ties into human-first design—and the balance between short-term - often tying into survival - goals and long-term resilience.

### [You must be Crazy to do pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aItVJprLYkg) (24 min)

This one actually is a based and informed take. I speaks in practical terms and is backed by tons of research that, in the end, say why you should try it anyway, what it would cost you and what would you get in return.

But also do a temperature check with [Fowler's Forrest and Dessert](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ForestAndDesert.html) to properly time the adoption and not generate unnecessary  difficulties along the way.

## CODE AND ENGINEERING

### [The Forgotten Art of Structured Programming – Kevlin Henney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFv8Wm2HdNM) (1.5h)

You might roll your eyes at the `goto` examples, but hear him out.  
Kevlin dives deep into the fractals of language, structure, and failure—and how we’ve been repeating the same mistakes since day zero.

You might even get the urge to pick up Scratch or revisit [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) with your family.

## C++ AND OTHER GC-LESS PROS

### [Trading at Light Speed: Designing Low-Latency Systems in C++ – David Gross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uAW5FQtcvE) (1h)

Sustained efficiency *and* elegance.  
Seen this approach in action—very maintainable, shockingly scalable. Think tight loops, measured abstractions, and long-term ownership.

And just to balance the equation...

### [Bjarne Says C++ Is Under Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfx9iV7GuNk) (YouTube commentary)

A loud but entertaining take on C++’s cultural moment.  
Equal parts panic and performance art.

## TESTING AND QUALITY

### [TDD – Where Did It All Go Wrong?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM) (1h)

Take an **alarming** note of the word **“ALL”**.  
Most of us got it wrong. This one challenges you to actually look at your tests and ask: do they *help* or *hurt*?

Still, you do run your code before pushing, right?

### [Test All the F Time Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMU6SjMZq1Q) (12 min)

I'll just leave it here.

## HUMANE UX

### [The Immutable Rules of UX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtBeg5eyEHU)

Solid breakdown of UX laws that often get ignored.  
Watch this once, and you’ll notice every app you use breaking at least five of them.

### [Valve Playtest Comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT6bR1OmwtM&list=PLTDOqN-X54Xw5-NCsEiAWDv2wuALLGLCg&index=1) *(Playlist)*

Loop this in the background and absorb what *real* user feedback sounds like.---

## THE CONSEQUENCE OF SOFTWARE

### [Captain Disillusion: World’s Greatest Blenderer – Blender Conf 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qSTcxt2t74) (42 min)

A surprisingly technical talk on modeling hidden in showmanship and synths.  
Watch it for the Blender hurts. Stay for the culture.

Additionally, let's take a look at game designers and real heroes we imagined ourselves to become someday.

### [Dave Farley's precise cutting take on Cyberpunk 2077 launch difficulties](https://youtu.be/E-jGEtqB4wU?si=HSl5q5ON1WdWrKTK&t=129)

Please be kind to the engineers you work with. No one's perfect and nothing lasts. And even the ones that inspire us take a misstep that might hurt a little.
